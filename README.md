## Figuring Out How to Figure Things Out

  At times, life at Turing can feel much like jumping into the deep
end of a pool with your hands tied behind your back. The curriculum is
challenging to say the least, and you never quite fully understand exactly
what you are doing. What makes the Turing experience so special is that you
somehow always find a way swim, even when your hand are tied behind your back.

  Prior to Turing, I had zero technical experience. I spent my college days
studying the business side of Intercollegiate Athletics and the closest I
ever came to being technical was force quitting Microsoft Word whenever it
froze. I also accidentally opened my terminal once and proceeded to hold down
the power button until my computer turned off because I thought I broke
something. Anyway, I could go on and on about how I had never done anything
technical prior to Turing, but that stuff is boring and you probably don't
want to hear about it, so I'll do my best not to bore you to death any longer.

  Fast Forward to 4pm on day 1 at Turing and I'm sitting at my desk trying to
figure out how to get the words 'fizz' and 'buzz' to print from my terminal.
At this point, I wasn't even sure how to open a file from the terminal, let
alone write a program that will iterate through one hundred numbers and print
'buzz' when the number is divisible by 5. Yet there I sat, trying to figure out
the best way to tell my Mom this just wasn't for me.

I'm joking...sort of.

  This was the first time in my life where I seriously began to doubt my
academic abilities. Throughout grade school and college, academics had always
come quite naturally to me. If I had a test on Wednesday, it just meant that
I wouldn't be able to go out with me friends on Tuesday night because
I would be in the library skimming my textbook for 14 straight hours. After
the long night in the library, I would stroll into class, take the test, and
leave the room knowing I got a solid B+. That is what always worked for me. It
was my system. There was nothing to figure out. Reading a book for 14 hours and
then taking a test had always worked for me, I never had to think about how
it was going to get done.

  This is what makes Turing so challenging. I never know what I'm doing, and
I'm pretty sure that most students who go through this program never actually
know what they are doing either. Turing challenges you to think outside the
box. To be honest, I now realize that I didn't even fully understand what it
meant to 'think outside the box' until I enrolled at Turing. The most
important thing that I've learned at Turing is that nobody every really knows
what they are doing. You have to get comfortable being extremely uncomfortable.
You are forced to figure things out that literally seem impossible. Yet, time
and time again, these impossible tasks somehow get done. Although this has been
the most challenging, stressful seven months of my life, I could not be more
grateful that I have had the opportunity to come to Turing. I'm fully confident
that when I step into my career as a developer, there will be no task too
tall. Turing has given me the ability to figure things out when I don't even
have the slightest idea as to where to begin. Aside from programming, I think
the lessons I have learned at Turing will carry over into my personal life as
well. I've come to realize that the majority of people probably don't
have any idea what they are doing either, and that this same majority
somehow always seem to figure it out. Learn to love being uncomfortable,
and there won't be anything that you cannot figure out.
